**Vehicle insurance** is insurance for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles. Its main purpose is to provide financial protection against:

* Physical damage or bodily injury caused by traffic collisions
* Liability that could arise from incidents in a vehicle

Vehicle insurance may additionally offer financial protection against theft of the vehicle and against damage to the vehicle sustained because of events other than traffic collisions such as keying, weather or natural disasters, and damage sustained by colliding with stationary objects.

We have here different data for train and test, however, in the test data the column that we want to predict do not exist. Therefore, we only use the train data.

# **Task**

* Condition: Predict if the vehicle provided in the image is damaged or not
* Amount: Based on the condition of a vehicle, predict the insurance amount of the cars that are provided in the dataset
